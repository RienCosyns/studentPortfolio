Algorithms in JavaScript
========================

There are a lot of algorithm examples out there in C/C++, Java, etc. This is a collection of algorithms in JavaScript
that can be easily tested on your system or using an online environment like [CoderPad](https://coderpad.io/). Each
module is completely self-contained: it contains an algorithm implementation and verification tests. 

Run tests

```
npm install
npm test
```

Test individual modules:

```
npm install
npm install -g mocha
node src/<filename>
```
